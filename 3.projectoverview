Here's a high-level overview document outlining the architecture of the SplitMate project based on the provided information:

# SplitMate Project Architecture Overview

## Project Configuration

- Vue CLI version: @vue/cli 5.0.8
- Node version: v16.14.0 (LTS)
- npm version: 8.3.1

## Core Dependencies

- Vue: ^3.2.13
- Vuetify: ^3.0.0
- Vuex: ^4.0.0
- Core-js: ^3.8.3

## Project Structure

The SplitMate project follows a standard Vue CLI project structure with additional configurations for Vuetify and Vuex. Here's an overview of the main components and their organization:

```

├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── router/
│   ├── store/
│   ├── views/
│   ├── App.vue
│   └── main.js
├── tests/
├── .eslintrc.js
├── babel.config.js
├── package.json
└── vue.config.js
```

## Key Modules and Their Interactions

1. **Vue 3**: The core framework for building the user interface.
2. **Vuetify 3**: Provides pre-built Vue components and a Material Design framework.
3. **Vuex 4**: State management library for Vue applications.
4. **Vue Router**: Handles navigation and routing within the application.

These modules interact as follows:

- Vue 3 serves as the foundation, with components defined in the `src/components/` directory.
- Vuetify components are used throughout the application for consistent UI design.
- Vuex manages the global state, with store modules likely defined in `src/store/`.
- Vue Router manages navigation between different views in the `src/views/` directory.

## Module, Folder, and Team Responsibility Table

| Module/Folder | Purpose | Responsible Team |
|---------------|---------|------------------|
| src/components/ | Reusable Vue components | Frontend |
| src/views/ | Page-level Vue components | Frontend |
| src/router/ | Application routing | Frontend |
| src/store/ | Vuex state management | Frontend |
| src/assets/ | Static assets (images, fonts, etc.) | Frontend |
| public/ | Public static assets | Frontend |
| tests/ | Unit and integration tests | Frontend |

## Development Workflow

1. Components are developed in the `src/components/` directory.
2. Views (pages) are created in the `src/views/` directory.
3. Routing is configured in `src/router/index.js`.
4. Global state management is handled in `src/store/index.js` and related modules.
5. Styling is likely done using Vuetify components and SASS for custom styles.
6. Unit tests are written in the `tests/` directory.

## Build and Deployment

The project uses Vue CLI for development, building, and deployment:

- Development server: `npm run serve`
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Linting: `npm run lint`

The built files will be generated in the `dist/` directory, which can be deployed to a web server or hosting platform.

## Conclusion

The SplitMate project is a modern Vue 3 application with a well-organized structure, utilizing Vuetify for UI components and Vuex for state management. The frontend team is responsible for all aspects of the application, from component development to testing and deployment.
